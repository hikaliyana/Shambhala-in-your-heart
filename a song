In the heat of July
we are jealous of each other we are bored with our practice
we are angry at the neighbors 
our kitchens are messy our businesses fail
we drink out of spite and frustration is our only thought

Among them, there is one dakini with a single eye,
And turquoise hair blown gently by the wind.
She sends a song of love and the song goes like this:

HUM HUM HUM
If there is no joy of Mahamudra in the form,
If there is no joy of Mahamudra in the speech,
If there is no joy of Mahamudra in the mind,
How would you understand
That we Dakinis are the mother, sister, maid and wife.

And she shouts with such penetrating voice, saying:

Come, come, come
HUM HUM HUM
Join the EH and VAM circle.
